# Coins Counter

## Problem Statement:

Suppose you have a coin counting machine that provides input to your program.  
A bunch of mixed coins are placed into a hopper and are sorted one-by-one.  
The machine sends a string of characters to your program.  

When a Penny is sorted, the character 'p' is concatenated with the string.  
When a Nickel is sorted 'n' is concatenated with the string. 

Other coins: Dimes, Quarters, Half-dollars all work the same way: the first letter of the name identifies the coin.  
Your program will read the string using the `input()` function and calculate the number of each type of coin, the value of each type of coin and the total monetary value represented.
